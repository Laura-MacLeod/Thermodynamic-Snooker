# Thermodynamic-Snooker

2nd year computing project, with limited guidance


Introduction (provided by Imperial College London):

How does the modern description of a gas link to classical thermodynamics? The kinetic energy is linked to the temperature and the force due to atoms bouncing off the container leads to pressure. Can we build a 2-dimensional simulation of a gas and animate it to illustrate and investigate these links?

Project Aims:
Write a code to describe a single ball bouncing inside a circular container
Incorporate this into an animation
Extend the code to include multiple balls
Calculate the temperature and pressure
Study the effects of varying the various parameters to deduce the basic laws of thermodynamics




Instructions:

Run the project module.

In the project file:
- Run cell 0 to import modules
- Run cell 1 to see simulation for a single balls
- Run cell 2 to see simulation for multiple balls
- Run cell 3 to see simulation for N balls initialised systematically
- Run cell 4 to get data for the multiple ball collisions

-Run cells 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 for graphs

- Avoid cells 6, 8, 10, 14 because they take a long time to run (did not have sufficient time to create CSV file before project deadline)
